## Definition of Done (DoD)
#### For a feature to be considered done, it has to fulfil the following criteria:
* Fulfil acceptance criteria defined in the User Story
* Pass all test-cases created for the User Story
## Branching Strategy
* Feature-based, each branch is for each feature <br>
* When a feature fulfils DoD, merge the feature branch into the main branch for other branches to merge main branch into their branch, so that they know that the feature fulfils DoD and they can access the features
## Merge Conflict rule
In the instance where the merging of a branch to the main branch results in a merge conflict
1. The person doing the merging will open the file with the merge conflict via github desktop
2. Screenshot the conflicting codes and send to the telegram groupchat
3. The person who coded the codes in the conflict will let the other person know whether to 'Accept Current Change', 'Accept Incoming Change', or 'Accept Both Changes'
4. If required, conduct a zoom call for better communication
