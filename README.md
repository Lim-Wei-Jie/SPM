## Branching Strategy
* Current: Trunk-based <br>
* Will be switching to Feature-based after tidying the code-base
## Merge Conflict rule
In the instance where the merging of a branch to the main branch results in a merge conflict
1. The person doing the merging will open the file with the merge conflict via github desktop
2. Screenshot the conflicting codes and send to the telegram groupchat
3. The person who coded the codes in the conflict will let the other person know whether to 'Accept Current Change', 'Accept Incoming Change', or 'Accept Both Changes'
4. If required, conduct a zoom call for better communication
